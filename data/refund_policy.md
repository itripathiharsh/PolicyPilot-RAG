# Refund Policy

We offer a 30-day return window for most items. To be eligible for a refund, items must be unused, in the same condition as received, and in the original packaging.

The following items are strictly non-refundable:
- Perishable goods (food, flowers)
- Personal care items (beauty products)
- Gift cards
- Downloadable software products

Refunds are processed within 7 to 10 business days after we receive and inspect the returned item. The refund will be issued to the original method of payment.

Please note that original shipping costs are non-refundable. If a refund is approved, the cost of return shipping will be the responsibility of the customer unless the item arrived damaged or was an incorrect shipment.

For items returned after the 30-day window but before 60 days, we may offer store credit at our discretion. No returns are accepted after 60 days.
