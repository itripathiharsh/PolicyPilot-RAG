# Cancellation Policy

Orders can be cancelled for a full refund within 12 hours of purchase. Once an order has entered the processing stage, typically after the 12-hour window, cancellations are no longer possible.

To cancel an order, contact support at support@company.com with your order number.

Special items, including personalized goods and custom-made furniture, cannot be cancelled once production has started, which usually begins 4 hours after the order is placed.

Subscription services can be cancelled at any time through the account settings. Cancellations will take effect at the end of the current billing cycle, and no partial refunds will be issued for remaining days in the cycle.
